<!-- 11.8 (Limericks) A limerick is a humorous five-line verse in which the first and second lines
rhyme with the fifth, and the third line rhymes with the fourth. Using techniques similar to those
developed in Exercise 11.7, write a script that produces random limericks. Polishing this program
to produce good limericks is a challenging problem, but the result will be worth the effort! 

11.7 Use four arrays of
strings called article, noun, verb and preposition. Create a sentence by selecting a word at random
from each array in the following order: article, noun, verb, preposition, article and noun. As each
word is picked, concatenate it to the previous words in the sentence. The words should be separated
by spaces. When the final sentence is output, it should start with a capital letter and end with a period.
The arrays should be filled as follows: 
the article array should contain the articles "the", "a", "one", "some" and "any"; 
the noun array should contain the nouns "boy", "girl", "dog", "town" and "car"; 
the verb array should contain the verbs "drove", "jumped", "ran", "walked" and "skipped";
the preposition array should contain the prepositions "to", "from", "over", "under" and "on" -->
