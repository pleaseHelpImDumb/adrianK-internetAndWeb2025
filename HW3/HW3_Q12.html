<!-- 10.14 Write a script to simulate the rolling of two dice. 
- The script should use Math.random to roll the first die and again to roll the second die. 
- The sum of the two values should then be calculated.
[Note: Since each die can show an integer value from 1 to 6, the sum of the values will vary from 2
to 12, with 7 being the most frequent sum, and 2 and 12 the least frequent sums. Figure 10.22
shows the 36 possible combinations of the two dice. Your program should roll the dice 36,000
times. Use a one-dimensional array to tally the number of times each possible sum appears. Display
the results in an HTML5 table. Also determine whether the totals are reasonable (e.g., there are six
ways to roll a 7, so approximately 1/6 of all the rolls should be 7).] -->
