<!-- 9.23 The use of computers in education is referred to as computer-assisted instruction (CAI).
One problem that develops in CAI environments is student fatigue. This problem can be eliminated
by varying the computer's dialogue to hold the student's attention. Modify the program in
Exercise 9.22 to print one of a variety of comments for each correct answer and each incorrect an-
swer. The set of responses for correct answers is as follows:
Very good!
Excellent!
Nice work!
Keep up the good work!
The set of responses for incorrect answers is as follows:
No. Please try again.
Wrong. Try once more.
Don't give up!
No. Keep trying.
Use random number generation to choose a number from 1 to 4 that will be used to select an
appropriate response to each answer. Use a switch statement to issue the responses.
