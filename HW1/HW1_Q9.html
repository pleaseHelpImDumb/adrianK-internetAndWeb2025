ment in which the user can enter a search query. Using the Firefox web browser, test the form by
entering January and submitting the form. Then enter a J in the input element to see previous en-
tries that started with J—January should be displayed below the input element. Enter June and sub-
mit the form again. Now enter a J in the input element to see previous entries that started with J—
January and June should be displayed below the input element. Try this with your own search que-
ries as well.-->
